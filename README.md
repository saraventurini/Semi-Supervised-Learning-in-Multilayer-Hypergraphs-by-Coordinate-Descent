# Semi-Supervised-Learning-in-Multilayer-Hypergraphs-by-Coordinate-Descent

## Proposed Methods
- GL: Generalized Louvain (in particular: in GL\_s communities are indexed by size and in GL\_r are indexed randomly).
- EVM: Louvain Expansion Method Function F-.
- EVP: Louvain Expansion Method Function F+.
- MA: Louvain Multiobjective Method Average (in particular: in MA\_s communities are indexed by size and in MA\_r are indexed randomly). 
- MVM: Louvain Multiobjective Method Function F-.
- MVP: Louvain Multiobjective Method Function F+.

## Artificial networks 
### SBM Stochastic Block Model
- adjacent\_matrix\_generator: creates a single-layer graph using the Stochastic Block Model 
- adjacent\_matrix\_generator_multi: creates a multi-layer graph for the informative case: each layer is informative. Each layer is created by the adjacent_matrix_generator.
-adjacent\_matrix\_generator\_multi\_r: creates a multi-layer graph for the noisy case: SOME layer noisy and SOME layers informative. Each layer is created by the adjacent_matrix_generator.

## Evaluation of the final partitions
- confusion_matrix: calculates the confusion matrix. It is used in "wrong" function and input of "NMI" function.
- reindex_com: reindexes communities. It is used in "confusion_matrix" function.
- wrong: counts the number of nodes in the wrong community. It is used to calculate the Accuracy of a partition.
- NMI: calculates the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) of a partition.

## Tests on Artificial Networks
### SBM
test\_ART: run all the artificial tests SBM (informative and real) reported in the paper.
- run: tests each methods on artificial networks SBM for the informative case.
- run\_n: tests each methods on artificial networks SBM for the noisy case.
### LFR
test_ART_LFR: run all the artificial tests LFR (informative and real) reported in the paper.
- run\_LFR: tests each methods on artificial networks LFR for the informative case .
- run\_n\_LFR: tests each methods on artificial networks LFR for the noisy case.

## Tests on Real Datasets
test\_REAL: run all the tests on real-world networks (informative and real) reported in the paper.
- REAL: tests each methods on real datasets.
- REAL\_n2: tests each methods on real datasets with noise (all informative layers + one noisy layer).
- REAL\_n3: tests each methods on real datasets with noise (first layer sum of all the real layers, second layer is noise).
